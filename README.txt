This app can start with `docker-compose up`.

It is mainly a Django Project and consists of the following parts:

- Django App called 'contacts' with a Person model and a Form to create.
- Django View and HTML Template Page to search for contacts with a name or email address. It is the homepage of the project.
- Django View and HTML Template Page to create a new contact using the form.
- Django REST Framework API to search for contacts using a name or email address.
- Django View and HTML Template Page with ReactJS to use the API to search for contacts.
